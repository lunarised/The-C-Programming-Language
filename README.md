# This is my repo for The C Programming Language (2nd Edition) by K & R

I am working through The C Programming Language in my own time. Mostly just so I can say I have done it, since I already know a reasonable amount of C. Since I am a sadist, I am doing some things differently to how the book does it

## Changes

Since I am a sadist, I am doing some things differently to how the book does it

- I am using gcc instead of cc.

  - This is because it is the main C Compier that I use in my general programming
  - I use the flags `-W -Wall -O2 -ansi -pedantic -Werror` just to ensure my code is as C90 like as I can make it

- I am occasionally using things that havent been fully explained yet in the book, in lieu of using the code examples provided. It is easier for me to write the code from scratch than to type out the code from my physical book

## Goals

- [ ] Chapter 1 finished by 23rd of May 2022
- [ ] Chapter 2 finished by 7th of June 2022
